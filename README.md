# subseasonal_forecasting_internship
This GitHub corresponds to the internship realized by Alexandre REBIERE from May to July 2023. It consisted in improving subseasonal forecasting by adding new features (Soil Moisture, Gross Primary Production, Ecosystem Respiration, Elevation, El Ni√±o ...) to an existing dataset used in the RODO forecast competition.
